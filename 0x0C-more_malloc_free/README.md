# C - More malloc, free

This repository contains examples and explanations of using `malloc` and `free` inC to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory.

In C, the `malloc` function is used to allocate memory dynamically at runtime, andthe `free` function is used to deallocate previously allocated memory. These functions are useful when the size of memory needed is not known at compile-time or when memory needs to be managed dynamically.

# More malloc, free
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about how to use `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc` and `exit` functions in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-malloc_checked.c` | Allocates memory using `malloc` |
| `1-string_nconcat.c` | Concatenates two strings |
| `2-calloc.c` | Allocates memory for an array, using `malloc` |
| `3-array_range.c` | Creates an array of integers |
| `100-realloc.c` | Reallocates a memory block using `malloc` and `free` |
