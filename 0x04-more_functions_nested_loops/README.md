# C - More Functions, More Nested Loops

Welcome to my personal repository for C programs focusing on utilizing more functions and nested loops. Here you will find a collection of programs that demonstrate the implementation of various algorithms and problem-solving techniques using a combination of functions and nested loops.


## Introduction

This repository serves as a platform for me to showcase my exploration of functions and nested loops in the C programming language. By delving into these programs, you will gain insights into how I approach complex problems and break them down into smaller, more manageable tasks using functions. Additionally, nested loops are extensively used to provide solutions to problems that require repetitive iterations.

Each program in this repository is accompanied by detailed comments and explanations that provide insights into the logic and functionality behind the code. I encourage you to explore, modify, and experiment with these programs to enhance your understanding of functions and nested loops in C.

## Requirements

To run the programs in this repository, you will need the following:

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Standard C library


## Contributing

While this repository primarily reflects my personal exploration, I am open to contributions. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional programs that highlight the use of functions and nested loops, please feel free to submit a pull request. When contributing, please ensure that your code adheres to the existing style and includes clear comments to explain the logic and functionality.
