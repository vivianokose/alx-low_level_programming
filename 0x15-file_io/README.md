## Introduction

File Input/Output (I/O) is an essential aspect of working with files in the C programming language. Understanding how to read from and write to files is crucial for tasks such as data processing, file manipulation, and more.

This repository provides examples and exercises to help you grasp the concepts and techniques involved in File I/O in C.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples and exercises, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/exampleuser/c-file-io.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd c-file-io`

Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system, such as GCC, to compile and run the code.

## Usage

The examples and exercises are organized into separate files, each focusing on a specific aspect of File I/O. Before running the code, compile the desired file using a C compiler. For example, to compile and run the `read_file.c` file, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -o read_file read_file.c
./read_file
```

Feel free to modify the code or explore different scenarios by referencing the examples and exercises provided.

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains several code files demonstrating different File I/O operations. Each example focuses on a specific scenario, such as reading from a file, writing to a file, or a combination of both.

Here are some of the examples available:

- `read_file.c`: Demonstrates how to read and display the contents of a file.
- `write_file.c`: Shows how to create a new file and write data into it.
- `append_file.c`: Illustrates how to open an existing file and append data to its end.

Feel free to explore and run these examples to deepen your understanding of File I/O in C.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are always welcome. If you have any improvements, bug fixes, or additional examples to share, please feel free to submit a pull request.

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes and ensure they align with the project's goals.
